the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.

This personality ethic, I began to realize, was the subconscious source of the solutions Sandra and I were attempting to use with our son

Our image of ourselves, and our role as good, caring parents was even deeper than our image of our son and perhaps influenced it.    There was a lot more wrapped up in the way we were seeing and handling the problem than our concern for our son's welfare. 


As Sandra and I talked, we became painfully aware of the powerful influence of our character and motives and of our perception of him.

Instead of trying to change him, we tried to stand apart -- to separate us from him -- and to sense his identity, individuality, separateness, and worth.

Through deep thought and the exercise of faith and prayer, we began to see our son in terms of his own uniqueness.    We saw within him layers and layers of potential that would be realized at his own pace and speed.    We decided to relax and get out of his way and let his own personality emerge.    We saw our natural role as being to affirm, enjoy, and value him.    We also conscientiously worked on our motives and cultivated internal sources of security so that our own feelings of worth were not dependent on our children's "acceptable" behavior. 


 stopped trying to kindly, positively manipulate him into an acceptable social mold.    Because we saw him as fundamentally adequate and able to cope with life, we stopped protecting him against the ridicule of others. 


Sandra and I believe that our son's "socially impressive" accomplishments were more a serendipitous expression of the feelings he had about himself than merely a response to social reward.

 brought to our awareness on a very personal level the vital difference between the personality ethic and the character ethic of success

They represent the internalization of correct principles upon which enduring happiness and success are based. 


Both the The Character Ethic The Personality Ethic are examples of social paradigms

In the more general sense, it's the way we "see" the world -- not in terms of our visual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, understanding, and interpreting. 



If you have the right map of Chicago, then diligence becomes important, and when you encounter frustrating obstacles along the way, then attitude can make a real difference.    But the first and most important requirement is the accuracy of the map

Each of us has many, many maps in our head, which can be divided into two main categories: maps of the way things are, or realities, and maps of the way things should be, or values

The instructor was using it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.    It's not logical; it's psychological

 frequently use this perception demonstration in working with people and organizations because it yields so many deep insights into both personal and interpersonal effectiveness

by Thomas Kuhn in his highly influential landmark book,

every significant breakthrough in the field of scientific endeavor is first a break with tradition, with old ways of thinking, with old paradigms.

 Paradigm Shifts move us from one way of seeing the world to another.  And those shifts create powerful change.

It becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors.  But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on our basic paradigms. 


unique to 

If you don't let a teacher know what level you are -- by asking a question, or revealing your ignorance -- you will not learn or grow.    You cannot pretend for long, for you will eventually be found out.    Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education. 

Thoreau taught, "How can we remember our ignorance, which our growth requires, when we are using our knowledge all of the time?"

 I borrowed strength  from  my  position  and authority and forced her to do what I wanted her to do. 
But borrowing strength builds weakness.  It builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces dependence on external factors to get things done.  It builds weakness in the person forced to acquiesce, stunting the development of independent reasoning, growth, and internal discipline.    And finally, it builds weakness in the relationship.  Fear replaces cooperation, and both people involved become more arbitrary and defensive

My experience has been that there are times to teach and times not to teach

When relationships are strained and the air charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of judgment and rejection

Really helping our children grow may involve being patient enough to allow them the sense of possession as well as being wise enough to

The way we see the problem is the problem.

The significant  problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. 


even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. 


The Inside-Out approach says that Private Victories TM precede Public Victories TM, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others.    It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve

relationships with others before improving ourselves

Inside-Out is a process -- a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern human growth and progress.    It's an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms of responsible independence and effective interdependence. 


And in all of my experience, I have never seen lasting solutions to problems, lasting happiness and success, that came from the outside in. 


, I am convinced we will discover and rediscover the truth of T. S. Eliot's observation: We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time

Our character, basically, is a composite of our habits.    "Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny," the maxim goes.

More energy was spent in the first few minutes of lift-off, in the first few miles of travel, than was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles

Lift off" takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the gravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension. 


For our purposes, we will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire

Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why.  Skill is the how to do.  And desire is the motivation, the want to do.    In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three

But knowing I need to listen and knowing how to listen is not enough.  Unless I want to listen, unless I have the desire, it won't be a habit in my life.  Creating a habit requires work in all three dimensions

By working on knowledge, skill, and desire, we can break through to new levels of personal and interpersonal effectiveness as we break with old paradigms that may have been a source of pseudo-security for years. 


Independence is the paradigm of I -- I can do it; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose. 


Dependent people need others to get what they want.  Independent people can get what they want through their own effort.    Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success. 


Independent thinking alone is not suited to interdependent reality.  Independent people who do not have the maturity to think and act interdependently may be good individual producers, but they won't be good leaders or team players.  They're not coming from the paradigm of interdependence necessary to succeed in marriage, family, or organizational reality

Life is, by nature, highly interdependent.  To try to achieve maximum effectiveness through independence is like trying to play tennis with a golf club -- the tool is not suited to the reality. 


but I'm not suggesting that you put yourself in isolation for several years until you fully develop Habits 1, 2, and 3.

Habit 7 is the habit of renewal -- a regular, balanced renewal of the four basic dimensions of life.    It circles and embodies all the other habits

.  They become the basis of a person's character, creating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, maximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles in an upward spiral of growth

But as the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).

If you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on

golden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be without the asset that produces golden eggs. 

Effectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/PC Balance TM.  P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs.    PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs

In our quest for short-term returns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a computer, a washer or dryer, even our body or our environment

Keeping P and PC in balance makes

a tremendous difference in the effective use of physical assets

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn.    If we don't continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options.  We're locked into our present situation, running scared of our corporation or our boss's opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive. 


But if your paradigm is focused on Production, on getting the room clean, you might find yourself nagging her to do it.    You might even escalate your efforts to threatening or yelling, and in your desire to get the golden egg, you undermine the health and welfare of the goose. 


One of the immensely valuable aspects of any correct principle is that it is valid and applicable in a wide variety of circumstances

Costs skyrocket; profits nose-dive.    And who gets blamed for the loss of golden eggs? You do.    Your predecessor liquidated the asset, but the accounting system only reported unit production, costs, and profit. 


Effectiveness lies in the balance.  Excessive focus on P results in ruined health, worn-out machines, depleted bank accounts, and broken relationships.    Too much focus on PC is like a person who runs for three or four hours a day, bragging about the extra 10 years of life it creates, unaware he's spending THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE                                                                        Brought to you by FlyHeart them running.    Or a person endlessly going to school, never producing, living on other people's golden eggs -- the eternal student syndrome. 


 would suggest that you shift your paradigm of your own involvement in this material from the role of learner to that of teacher.

Would you not agree that the P/PC Balance principle alone, if fully lived, would transform most individuals and organizations? 


That which we obtain too easily, we esteem too

lightly.    It is dearness only which gives everything its value.    Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods

Habit 1: Be Proactive  -- Principles of Personal Visio

They are often more projections than reflections, projecting the concerns and character weaknesses of people giving the input rather than accurately reflecting what we are. 


Look at the word responsibility -- "response-ability" -- the ability to choose your response

Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling. 


Because we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives are a function of conditioning and conditions, it is because we have, by conscious decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us. 

 

 In making such a choice, we become reactive.    Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment.  If the weather is good, they feel good.  If it isn't, it affects their attitude and their performance.  Proactive people can carry their own weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them.  They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn't a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not

Reactive people are also affected by their social environment

.  Reactive people build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering the weaknesses of other people to control them

The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person.

Proactive people are driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected

Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. 
But their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response

 Eleanor Roosevelt observed, "No one can hurt you without your consent." In the words of Gandhi, "They cannot take away our self respect if we do not give it to them." It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place. 


, "I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday," that person cannot say, "I choose otherwise." 


It's not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hurts us. 

Of course, things can hurt us physically or

economically and can cause sorrow

But our character, our basic identity, does not have to be hurt at all.

Our basic nature is to act, and not be acted upon

Many people wait for something to happen or someone to take care of them.    But people who end up with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, who seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary, consistent with correct principles, to get the job done. 


Holding people to the responsible course is not demeaning; it is affirming

the maturity level of the individual has to be taken into account.    We can't expect high creative cooperation from those who are deep into emotional dependence.    But we can, at least, affirm their basic nature and create an atmosphere where people can seize opportunities and solve problems in an increasingly self-reliant way.

act.    If you wait to be acted upon, you will be acted upon.    And growth and opportunity consequences attend either road. 


The organization does not have to be at the mercy of the environment; it can take the initiative to accomplish the shared values

But the Hollywood script does not describe the reality.    If our feelings control our actions, it is because we have abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to do so. 


Proactive people make love a verb.  Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving of self, like a mother bringing a newborn into the world.    If you want to study love, study those who sacrifice for others, even for people who offend or do not love in return

own degree of proactivity is to look at where we focus our time and energy

Direct control problems are solved by working on our habits

 Indirect control problems are solved by changing our methods of influence

No control problems involve taking the responsibility to change the line on the bottom on our face -- 
to smile, to genuinely and peacefully accept these problems and learn to live with them, even though we don't like them

Changing our habits, changing our methods of influence and changing the way we see our no control

problems are all within our Circle of Influence.

It's the nature of reactive people to absolve themselves of responsibility

But the president did not feel threatened because this man's strength complemented his strength and compensated for his weaknesses

.  Proactive people aren't pushy.  They're smart, they're value driven, they read reality, and they know what's needed. 


One way to determine which circle our concern is in is

to distinguish between the have's and the be's

The Circle of Concern is filled with the have's

The Circle of Influence is filled with the be's -- I can be more patient, be wise, be loving.    It's the character focus. 


Anytime we think the problem is "out there," that thought is the problem.    We empower what's out there to control us.    The change paradigm is "outside-in" -- what's out there has to change before 

The proactive approach is to change from the Inside-Out: to be different, and by being different, to effect positive change in what's out there -- I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative

But we are responsible -- 
"response-able" -- to control our lives and to powerfully influence our circumstances by working on be, on what we are. 


Our behavior is governed by principles.  Living in harmony with them brings positive consequences

violating them brings negative consequences

The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it.

The commitments we make to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those commitments, is the essence and clearest manifestation of our proactivity. 


It is here that we find two ways to put ourselves in control of our lives immediately.    We can make a promise -- and keep it.  Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it.  As we make and keep commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own lives.  By making and keeping promises to ourselves and others, little by little, our honor becomes greater than our moods

The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits

would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days.    Simply try it and see what happens.  For 30 days work only in your Circle of Influence.  Make small commitments and keep them.  Be a light, not a judge.  Be a model, not a critic.  Be part of the solution, not part of the problem. 


Try it in your marriage, in your family, in your job.  Don't argue for other people's weaknesses. 


Look at the weaknesses of others with compassion, not accusation.    It's not what they're not doing or should be doing that's the issue.    The issue is your own chosen response to the situation and what you should be doing.    If you start to think the problem is "out there," stop yourself.    That thought is the problem. 


We are responsible for our own effectiveness, for our own happiness, and ultimately, I would say, for most of our circumstances

.  For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you.  How often do you use and hear reactive phrases such as "If only," "I can't," or "I have to" 


Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, you would probably behave reactively.    Review the situation in the context of your Circle of Influence.

How could you respond proactively? Take several moments and create the experience vividly in your mind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner.  Remind yourself of the gap between stimulus

and response.    Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose. 


.    Select a problem from your work or personal life that is frustrating to you.    Determine whether it is a direct, indirect, or no control problem.  Identify the first step you can take in your Circle of Influence to solve it and then take that step

Try the 30-day test of proactivity.  Be aware of the change in your Circle of Influence. 




 

Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind TM 

What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us 
 

 "Begin with the End in Mind" is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. 


 clear understanding of your destination.    It means to know where you're going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction

It is possible to be busy -- very busy -- without being very effective

higher income, more recognition or a certain degree of professional competence, only to find that their drive to achieve their goal blinded them to the things that really mattered most and now are gone. 


When you Begin with the End in Mind, you gain a different perspective.    One man asked another on the death of a mutual friend, "How much did he leave?" His friend responded, "He left it all."

All Things Are Created Twice 
"Begin with the End in Mind" is based on the principle that all things are created twice

that end clearly in mind as you interact with your children on a daily basis.    You can't behave toward them in ways that undermine their self-discipline or self-esteem. 


It's a principle that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design.    In our personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstances outside

Habit 2 is based on principles of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first creation.    Leadership is not management.    Management is the second creation, which we'll discuss in the chapter on Habit 3.    But leadership has to come first

"Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things." Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

Effectiveness -- often even survival -- does not depend solely on how much effort we expend, but on whether or not the effort we expend is in the right jungle

Proactive powerful leadership must constantly monitor environmental change, particularly customer buying habits and motives, and provide the force necessary to organize resources in the right direction. 


If industries do not monitor the environment, including their own work teams, and exercise the creative leadership to keep headed in the right direction, no amount of management expertise can keep them from failing. 


 And leadership is even more lacking in our personal lives.    We're into managing with efficiency, setting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values. 



 proactivity is based on the unique human endowment of self-awareness. 


exercise personal leadership in our lives are imagination and

conscience

 think one of the most inspiring accounts of the rescripting process comes from the autobiography of Anwar Sadat, past president of Egypt

My focus is not on the long-term growth and understanding but on the short-term behavior.    I'm trying to win the battle, not the war

 my children are outwardly submissive and inwardly rebellious

conscience, I can examine my deepest values.    I can realize that the script I'm living is not in harmony with those values, that my life is not the product of my own proactive design, but the result of the first creation I have deferred to circumstances and other people.    And I can change.    I can live out of my imagination instead of my memory.    I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past.    I can become my own first creator. 


The most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission statement or philosophy or creed.  It focuses on what you want to be (character) and to do (contributions and achievements) and on the values or principles upon which being and doing are based 


People can't live with change if there's not a changeless core inside them

The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value. 


Once you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity
